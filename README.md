# Assembly Code Bug: Buffer Overflow and Memory Access Violation

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: a potential buffer overflow and a memory access violation. The code attempts to access memory beyond array boundaries and write to a potentially invalid memory location.

The `bug.asm` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version with detailed explanations of the fixes.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in the following lines of assembly code:

```assembly
mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ; Potential buffer overflow
mov dword ptr [eax], 10 ; Potential memory access violation
```

- **Buffer Overflow:** The `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]` instruction calculates a memory address based on `ebx`, `ecx`, and an assumed array element size of 4 bytes.  If `ecx` exceeds the valid array index, this leads to accessing memory outside the allocated array, potentially overwriting other data.
- **Memory Access Violation:** The subsequent `mov dword ptr [eax], 10` instruction uses the address stored in `eax` to write data. If `eax` points to an invalid or protected memory region, this will result in a memory access violation, leading to a program crash.

## Solution

The solution involves adding bounds checking to ensure that `ecx` is within the valid range of array indices before performing memory access. The corrected code is provided in `bugSolution.asm`.
